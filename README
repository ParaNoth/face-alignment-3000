If you don't have the 300w_cropped dataset, run
    ./setup.sh
or if you already have it, you can do the steps after the downloading part of setup.sh

After dataset preparation, run
    python train.py
to do the training. Python 3 is used here.

After Training, run
    python test.py
to do the testing.
